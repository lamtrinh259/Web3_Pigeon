# Web3 Pigeon

This is the official submission for ETH-Vietnam hackathon 2022 from team Web3 Pigeon.

We have rebuilt the repo so that the different components are safely segmented in order to avoid dependency conflicts:
1. Backend contains the smart contracts and many backend functions for the project to run.
2. Bot contains the code for the bot to run from the (central) server to check on rules and conditions.
3. Web3_Pigeon_Frontend contains all the necessary files and folders for the app to work. App was built with Create React App.

Simple Figma prototype (clickable) of the dapp is here: https://www.figma.com/proto/ASKZQY0VqARHTJoaTBfLpH/Pigeon---ETHVietnam?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=358%3A135&viewport=-3851%2C-54%2C0.2&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=145%3A361
